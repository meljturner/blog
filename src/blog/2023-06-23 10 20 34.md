Changes in the structure of our electoral system are likely to require constitutional approval, meaning endorsement by 50% of the population and a majority of provinces. This is a scary prospect for our politicians who seem to fear any in-depth discussion of policy, especially one that might change the status-quo.

This means we should only seek changes that are overwhelmingly popular and which are incremental. One idea that has broad support is proportional representation but the proposed solutions have focused on the Commons and are sufficiently complex that they did not sustain a national discussion.

For the Commons this document proposes we stay with the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system and maintain all the Canadian traditions that have led to mostly stable governments. Also, it proposes we stay with an appointed Senate but with a fundamental and important difference. We should make the Senate proportionally represent the population, based on the most recent general election, with members appointed by each established party (i.e. any political party gaining more than 2% of the national popular vote). This takes away a key privilege of the Prime Minister and shares that privilege with the other major party leaders. The senatorial appointment process would be administered by Elections Canada in consultation with the party leaders and reporting directly to the Governor General.
## The Senate
To say that the Senate proportionately represents the population is simple but the rules under which appointments are made need to be considered carefully for neutrality and fairness. The Senate has just over 100 seats so each established party would appoint at least two members. There would be no Independent members unless appointed by one of the established parties.

The parties should be constrained to respect regional proportionality as well, if possible, based on where their votes came from in the general election. There will be public pressure to balance gender and perhaps other representative characteristics.

Undoubtedly new traditions will establish themselves but a case can be made to appoint Senators with specific expertise so that the governing party can draw its ministers from a professionally qualified group. Certainly, key party members who lose their seats might still be appointed as a Senator. Note also that the term of appointment is only a single Parliament; no lifelong members, less sycophancy and more opportunity for change over time.
## The Commons
Although no change is proposed for the Commons, a proportional Senate will change the balance between the two Houses. The Commons derives its legitimacy from being directly elected, while the Senate would gain its legitimacy from its proportional representation. The Commons could no longer count on the Senate rubber-stamping its legislation, leading to more consultation in committee.
## Seat Allocation
In the first table below the population is shown by province and territory in thousands and as a percentage. Also shown is the current number of Commons seats. Allocating Senate seats proportionately by population (1% = 1 seat). However, we have to deal with the fact that our northern territories and our smallest provinces probably need to be over-represented. This can be achieved, not by penalizing other provinces but by adding a few seats. If we stipulate that each province should have a minimum of two senatorial seats, and each territory a minimum of one seat, we have the proposed allocation for a total of 106 seats. Also note the raw total of 101 seats, the extra one resulting from requiring whole numbers for each province.

The second table shows how the 2019 popular vote was distributed among the established parties (votes for independents and others have been distributed proportionately to the established parties)

Just referring to the national popular vote, this result would lead to 34 Liberal, 36 Conservative, 16 NDP, 8 Bloque Quebecois and 7 Green seats in the Senate, for a total of 101. To maintain these row totals and get whole numbers for each province and territory a balancing process is required that is a bit more complicated than simple rounding.

Next, we have to add the extra seats for the small provinces and territories. These five ‘extra’ seats should go to the most popular parties in those regions; i.e. Liberals get 3 extra for NL, YT and NT, the Conservatives get one extra for NL and the NDP get one extra for NU. The 2019 configuration would look like the following.

For the more populous provinces the parties must ensure that regional representation is respected, just as the Prime Minister is currently required to respect provincial quotas of senatorial seats.
## Conclusion
In practice, because some numbers are small, the results as whole numbers will make it difficult for parties to fully respect regional proportionality. They should be accorded flexibility on this criteria, understanding that they are accountable to those regional populations. Grouping the provinces to make the regional populations more equal would provide the necessary flexibility (i.e. Western Canada, Ontario, Quebec, Eastern Canada and the Territories).

A proportional Senate is likely to be much more functional than the current model. Even if the election results in a majority government, the Senate is likely to be more balanced with no single party having an outright majority. This would encourage collaboration and informal coalitions in passing legislation. It would likely prevent even a majority government from pushing through unpopular or flawed legislation.

This proposal is not complex and could be agreed among the established parties and passed as legislation in both houses. Although it is a change in traditional practice, in my opinion it is not a change in the constitution. The senate is still technically appointed by the Governor General representing the Crown, respecting advice received from the Prime Minister or delegated party leaders.
