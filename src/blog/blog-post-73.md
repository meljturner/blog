## The River Belle Inn
Denise organized our family reunion at The River Belle Inn in Healdsburg, Ca. A wonderful place to stay and well suited to our first reunion with the Carter family. We could not have been made more welcome and felt immediately part of the family.

## Sea Ranch
Following the reunion, Denise and Dan invited us to stay with them at Sea Ranch, a relaxed community on the Pacific Coast with beautiful views of the ocean. We walked along the cliffs and visited the beach where Jill and Denise collected driftwood. We also visited a local chapel with a unique architecture.

## Vacaville
To complete our trip we spent several days at the home of Jeannyne and Jerry. They treated us to tours of the local wine country and some great food. A real opportunity to get to know them.
