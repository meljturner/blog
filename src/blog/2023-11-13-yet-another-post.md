## Chic visits Almonte

My brother Chic visited Almonte in September 2023 where we met for the very first time! How could one not meet his younger brother until the age of 78? It's a long story.

That story is best told by this poem I wrote, just after Chic's visit:

```
    You may have heard similar stories before,
    Of romances near the end of the war,
    My mother for a starter,
    Knew a captain called Carter,
    I was conceived July 4th, â€˜44.

    Of this I was quite unaware,
    Through childhood, life and career,
    But once my parents departed,
    An old aunt imparted,
    This story from yesteryear.

    Many things in my life have amazed me,
    Not least the parents that raised me,
    But the latest and best,
    Was a DNA test,
    The results of which really fazed me.

    In short the DNA showed,
    A new brother with more to unfold.
    I was soon to discover,
    Two more sisters and a brother,
    Long-lost bonds, a story to be told.

    Once separate lives, intertwined,
    Mother's secret, forever defined.
    With love and communion,
    A sibling reunion,
    Kinship, the best one could find.
```
