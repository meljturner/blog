Late in 2022 I received the results of a DNA test that revealed a close match to Chic Carter, a retired airline pilot living in San Antonio, TX. After a failed attempt to contact Chic via the Ancestry website, I did further research and eventually obtained his street address and wrote a letter to see if further contact was possible.

Chic immediately called me and acknowledged a family resemblance to some photos I had sent and welcomed me as a member of the Carter family! In fact, he revealed that I have four new siblings: Jeannyne, Chic (Charles), Carl and Denise.

Recently Chic made a trip to our home in Almonte and stayed a few days to get to know Jill and I. To commemorate, I wrote a poem that relates the history as it unfolded, including a planned family reunion coming in October.

You may have heard similar stories before,
Of romances near the end of the war,
My mother for a starter,
Knew a captain called Carter,
I was conceived July 4th, â€˜44.

Of this I was quite unaware,
Through childhood, life and career,
But once my parents departed,
An old aunt imparted,
This story from yesteryear.

Many things in my life have amazed me,
Not least the parents that raised me,
But the latest and best,
Was a DNA test,
The results of which really fazed me.

In short the DNA showed,
A new brother with more to unfold.
I was soon to discover,
Two more sisters and a brother,
Long-lost bonds, a story to be told.

Once separate lives, intertwined,
Mother's secret, forever defined.
With love and communion,
A sibling reunion,
Kinship the best one can find
