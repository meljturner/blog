### The voiceover

```
    Our story begins in Almonte,
    A beautiful town to see,
    The Turners constructed a house nearby
    When Graham had just turned three.

    A grand little chap was young Graham,
    When dressed in his best, quite a swell,
    He had a young sister called Karen,
    and a dog called Kanga as well.

    Other relatives lived in England,
    Grandparents, Aunties and kin,
    No one to help with upbringing,
    So that's where the Carrolls come in.

    While Ma and Pa Turner were working,
    The Carrolls looked after the kids.
    There was Betty and Gerald the parents,
    Susan, Pat, and Peter and Chris.

    Junior school went by quite quickly,
    At hockey and soccer he was fast,
    Listen to these boyhood memories,
    From Derek, best friend from his class.

    Now Canada is known for its winters,
    And Graham could ski and could skate.
    The Venables remember his antics
    From our annual February date.

    The Earl of March was his high school,
    New friends and an interest in art.
    Photography, dancing and music
    Were also playing their part.

    Learning to drive was important
    When ten years plus six had passed
    He excelled as the designated driver
    When friends were high or half-assed.

    He went to college in Kingston,
    To train in graphic design.
    Typography, mixed media and fashion
    And how all these things could combine.

    Back home to live with the parents,
    Find a job, save money and more,
    Exploit his education and training,
    He ends up in a video store.

    If there's one thing his friends all remember
    Graham didn't drink, smoke or fight
    Instead it was iced tea and soda
    And apples he ate in one bite.

    He's back into community soccer
    And basketball too with his mates.
    He's a mentor to videoflicks workers
    And advising Almontonians on tapes.

    At last he'd saved up some money,
    Because at home he didn't pay rent.
    He announced that he wanted to travel
    So to London, England he went.

    He may have been new to London
    But England he'd been to before.
    He had relations all over the country,
    Aunts, Uncles and cousins galore.

    At the start he lived with Aunt Susan,
    But soon got a place on his own.
    Made friends with expat Australians,
    Got a job at Mambo downtown.

    At Mambo he soon became manager,
    Planned orders and monitored trends.
    More importantly, met lots of people,
    Cam, Gabe and Adam were some of his friends.

    When Mambo fell out of fashion,
    Or maybe it had just been outgrown,
    He joined Paul Smith the designer
    Bespoke tailor, and Man about town.

    He explored London by walking around,
    Taking photos and honing his craft.
    His dream of professional photographer
    Was finally coming to pass.

    He'd done hydrants and signs and graffiti,
    Festivals, nightclubs and bands.
    But how could it make him some money
    For lodging and living demands.

    â€˜Twas Paul Smith that forced the issue,
    GT got a lay-off advance.
    That helped him buy some equipment,
    And become entirely free-lance.

    His pictures of friends became legend,
    His portraits of kids were the best,
    He was demanded at parties and weddings,
    For the photographic skills he possessed.

    There was just one important thing missing
    That no-one had dared to foretell,
    A soul-mate to share his successes,
    The lady we know as Adele.

    Without her there would be no party,
    No celebration for 50 years old.
    This video would not be recorded,
    GT's story would not have been told.
