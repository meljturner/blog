I have been using webtrees for a number of years to record the genealogy of my family and that of my wife, Jill. Recently I have added the ancestry of the Carter family after discovering that this is also my history.

## A Published Genealogy
I recently published a hard-copy version of the Carter family history titled "Edward Carter, Quaker immigrant to America, 1692". This document was originally authored by Orris E. Carter in 1959 and was captured from an original typed manuscript furnished by my brother, Chic Carter. I have edited and updated the document with additional research from Family Search, the online resource provided by The Church of Latter Day Saints. The printed document is available from Lulu.com.
